我是汕头大学计算机科学专业的大一学生。这个仓库主要用于个人学习记录，由于我正处于入门阶段，内容可能比较基础，主要是“程序设计基础”课程的练习代码。仓库公开是为了督促自己并接触开源社区，欢迎各位的批评与指正！

I am a first-year student majoring in Computer Science at Shantou University. This repository is primarily used for personal study records. As I am still at the beginner stage, the content may be relatively basic, mainly consisting of practice code for the "Fundamentals of Programming" course. The repository is public to hold myself accountable and to engage with the open-source community. All feedback and suggestions are welcome!
